# osu! Replay Viewer
_Based on osu!lazer_

This replay viewer allow you to view imported replays (yes you have to import them in osu!lazer
client) without launching the actual game, and you can also render replays to video files, thanks
to FFmpeg.

This project aims to make replay viewer without modifying the official game code or write entire
thing from scratch, but uses components from the game instead. Because of this, it's much more easy
to upgrade to make UI matches with actual game

> This project somewhat implemented [this](https://github.com/ppy/osu/discussions/12986) idea (except
  we're running outside the official client)

## Features
- View downloaded replays (now with custom skins support)
- Download replays (if you can log in)
- Render replays to video file (FFmpeg required)

## Basic Usage
```sh
# List all downloaded replays
# Look for replay GUID (something like f1bb0aa3-5111-4534-b93d-e1e20074f7fe) and pass it to
# --view local <GUID>
osu-replay-viewer --list

# View replay
osu-replay-viewer --view local f1bb0aa3-5111-4534-b93d-e1e20074f7fe

# List all available skins
osu-replay-viewer --list-skin

# View replay with given skin
osu-replay-viewer --skin select "osu!classic" --view local f1bb0aa3-5111-4534-b93d-e1e20074f7fe
```

## Requirements
- [.NET 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
- OpenGL ES 3.0 compatible device
- FFmpeg installed as command (a.k.a you must be able to run ``ffmpeg`` without including an entire
  path to it) if you want to render the replay to video

This replay viewer is not guranteed to works on platforms other than Windows, but at least it's managed
to works on Linux previously. If you have any problem related to Linux platform, please create a new
issue.

## Installing FFmpeg
1. Grab FFmpeg binaries [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
  > Linux users can also install FFmpeg from package manager included in their distribution

  > Windows users can download FFmpeg [here](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) or
    [here](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases)

2. Include ``ffmpeg`` in command line path
3. Confirm that it's working by running ``ffmpeg`` alone

> For the best encoding speed, you can install FFmpeg with hardware acceleration. To actually use
  hardware acceleration, see [hardware acceleration](#hardware-acceleration)

## Command Line arguments
> You can view all command line arguments by running the executable without arguments

## Build
To build this project, you need:

- .NET 5.0 SDK
- Git

Clone this repository (``git clone``), then build it with ``dotnet build`` command.

You can also build and run directly, using ``dotnet run osu-replay-viewer``

## Troubleshooting
### "No corresponding beatmap for the score could be found"
You need to import the beatmap to your current osu!lazer installation (works best with ranked maps).

## Tips
### Hardware Acceleration
To use hardware acceleration, you need:
- FFmpeg with hardware acceleration
- Compatible hardware (Intel, AMD or NVIDIA GPUs)
- Driver

Simply add ``--ffmpeg-encoder h264_<qsv/amf/nvenc>`` or ``--ffmpeg-encoder hevc<qsv/amf/nvenc>`` to
enable hardware encoding. (Eg: ``osu-replay-renderer --view local 1337 --record --ffmpeg-encoder h264_qsv``)

Here is the table for hardware encoders:
| Vendor | Encoder    | Codec | Note     |
|--------|------------|-------|----------|
| any    | libx264    | H.264 | Uses CPU |
| Intel  | h264_qsv   | H.264 |          |
| AMD    | h264_amf   | H.264 |          |
| NVIDIA | h264_nvenc | H.264 |          |
| any    | libx265    | HEVC  | Uses CPU |
| Intel  | hevc_qsv   | HEVC  |          |
| AMD    | hevc_amf   | HEVC  |          |
| NVIDIA | hevc_nvenc | HEVC  |          |

## Planned
This is the list of stuffs that I want to changes. It can be planned features or just revamp the code.

- Live Graphs (Live PP, accuracy or difficulty)
- Custom HUD from DLLs (similar to osu! custom rulesets)
- Customiztation
- Split CLI system to seperate project (if you're willing to use it)
- Change the project name
- Allow user to choose different osu!lazer application directory

> While Live PP Graph is currently possible, it would be nice if someone exposes them as bindables.
